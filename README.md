# Operators-overloading-of-monomials-and-polynomials
<br>In this reposytory, there is an implenetation of operators overloading to monomials and polynomials.
- Monomial is an expression of the following form: 
<br>(coefficient) * x ^ (degree)
- Polynomial is a combination of several monomials: 
<br>(coefficient_1) * x ^ (degree_1) +  (coefficient_2) * x ^ (degree_2) + ... + (coefficient_n) * x ^ (degree_n)

<br>The operators of the class Polynomial are: =, +, -, -=, +=, ==, !=, <<, >>, (), []
<br>The operators of the class Monomial are: =, +, -, *, *=, -=, +=, ==, !=, <<, >>, ()
